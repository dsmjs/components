# Components


We strive to embrace the component driven nature of React and approach the
development of our site as a composition of small components to build bigger
and bigger components. This approach is also known as
[Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

## Atomic Design

Our components are roughly organized to align with the goals of
[Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), both in
the organization on the filesystem and in the interactive demos available in
our [Storybook Instance](https://dsmjs.com/components/).
